wht are different types of polices in IAM???


In AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management), policies are rules that define permissions for users, groups, and roles to access AWS resources. 
There are four main types of IAM policies:

***********1. Identity-based Policies*****************
These are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles to control their permissions.
They allow or deny access to AWS services and resources.
Types:
Managed Policies:
AWS Managed Policies: Predefined policies created by AWS (e.g., AdministratorAccess, AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess).
Customer Managed Policies: Custom policies created and managed by you.

Inline Policies: Policies directly embedded within a user, group, or role.
[inline policy cannot cpied  or resude and once the instance is deleted policy also gets deleted]

*****************2. Resource-based Policies******************
These are attached to AWS resources like S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, or Lambda functions.
They define who can access the resource and what actions are allowed.
Example: An S3 bucket policy that allows a specific user or account to access the bucket.

********************3. Permissions Boundaries*****************
These are policies that set the maximum permissions for an IAM user or role.
Even if an identity-based policy grants permissions, a permissions boundary limits what actions they can perform.
Use Case: When delegating limited admin control to users.

*********************4. Service Control Policies (SCPs)******************
These are used with AWS Organizations to control permissions at the account or organizational unit (OU) level.
SCPs do not grant permissions but limit what can be done, even if a user has full permissions through identity-based policies.
Example: Denying access to specific regions for all accounts in an OU.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$More than one policy can be attached to a user or a group at the same time.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Policies canâ€™t be attached directly to resources like EC2 instance, S3 bucket etc.$$$$$$$$$$$$
