Installing Software: Install packages like Apache, Nginx, Java, or other required tools.
Running Custom Scripts: Execute custom commands to set up the environment.
Configuring Services: Start or enable services like a web server or database.
Deploying Applications: Pull code from GitHub or set up a deployment process.
When to Use User Data?
You go for User Data in the following situations:

Initial Setup Automation: You need to save time configuring an instance manually.
Consistency: Ensure the same configuration for all instances.
Application Deployment: Automate deploying your application on launch.
On-Demand Setup: Spin up instances with pre-defined setups when scaling infrastructure.

How to Answer in Interviews (Simple & Crisp)
"User Data is a script or set of commands that I provide while launching an EC2 instance. It helps automate tasks like software installation, configuring services, or deploying code during the instance's boot. 
For example, I can use User Data to install a web server like Apache and start it automatically when the instance is created."

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

This script:

Updates the system packages.
Installs Apache (httpd).
Starts and enables the web server.
Adds a simple welcome message to the index page.
