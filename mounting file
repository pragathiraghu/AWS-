"Mounting is the process of making a storage device accessible to the operating system by attaching it to a directory . Hereâ€™s how I would perform the mounting process step-by-step:

Check Attached Devices: Use the lsblk command to list block devices and identify the unmounted volume.
Format the Volume: If the volume is new, I would format it using mkfs.ext4 or another appropriate file system.
Create a Mount Point: I would create a directory using mkdir, such as /mnt/mydata, where the volume will be mounted.
Mount the Volume: Use the mount command, for example: sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/mydata.
Verify the Mount: Check if the volume is mounted using the df -h command.
Make the Mount Persistent (Optional): To ensure the mount persists after reboot, I would update the /etc/fstab file with the device details.
This process ensures that the volume is properly mounted and available for use in the file system."
