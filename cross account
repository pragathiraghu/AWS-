How to Answer in an Interview?
What is a cross-account role?
"A cross-account role allows users or services in one AWS account to securely access resources in another AWS account by assuming an IAM role."

Why do we use cross-account roles?
"We use it to securely share resources across AWS accounts, for example, allowing Jenkins in one account to deploy code to another account, without needing to share permanent credentials."

Can you give a project example?
"Yes. In a project, we had two AWS accounts: one for DevOps tools like Jenkins (Account A) and one for production resources (Account B). To allow Jenkins in Account A to deploy code to EC2 instances in Account B, we created a cross-account IAM role in Account B. Jenkins assumed this role using AWS CLI to generate temporary credentials and deploy the application."
